# Simulated-Annealing-and-Java-Interface
This was an internship project at Turkish Aerospace Industries ✈️ in 2016. One of the metaheuristic algorithms in the artificial intelligence 🧠 literature called Simulated Annealing has been implemented in order to solve a multi-objective allocation problem. A user interface in which a dataset(in Excel) can be imported has been also added to the project.


Technical Note: the Algorithm part begins after 750th line in java file **InterfaceTrialC.java** which can be found in **Simulated Annealing and UI** folder
