# Simulated-Annealing-and-Java-Interface
This was an internship project at Turkish Aerospace Industries in 2016. One of the metaheuristic algorithms in the artificial intelligence literature called Simulated Annealing has been implemented by only myself in only two months. A user interface in which a dataset(in Excel) can be imported has been also added to the project.

The Simulated Annealing Algorithm part begins after 750th line in java file **InterfaceTrialC.java** which can be found in **Simulated Annealing and UI** folder
